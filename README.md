# toast web application

Thank you so much City Tech servers for hosting my tiny code that some times I tickle someone with how do I download the no one probably ever logged on or signed up for an account it's ok thank you again I wish you the best for adding to my useless hobby skills :)

Pay me for your misinterpretations about the fact that I took a quick course via City Tech to gain much needed personal skills due to my supreme disappeal to technocrudites:  Nvm buy yourself or the nearby unhappy person next to you a fruit juice or something
